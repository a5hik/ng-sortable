#### Release:

Latest release verision 1.1.1

#### Demo Page:

[Demo Site] (http://a5hik.github.io/ng-sortable/)

Demo Includes:

- Drag between adjacent Lists.
- Controll Drag on Specific Destinations.

#### Features:

- Drag both Horizontally and Vertically.
- Drag and Drop items within a column.
- Drag and Drop items across columns.
- Can do Ranking by Sorting and Change Status by Moving.
- Hooks provided to invoke API's after a particular action.
- Preventing/Allowing Drop Zone can be determined at run time.
- Drag Boundary can be defined.

#### Implementation Details:

- Uses angular/native JS for sortable and draggable. no JQueryUI used.
- Provides callbacks for drag/drop events.
- Implementation follows Prototypical scope inheritance.

#### Directives structure:

The directives are structured like below.

    sortable                     --> Items list
      sortable-item              --> Item to sort/drag
        sortable-item-handle     --> Drag Handle 

#### Design details:

- ng-model is used to bind the sortable list items with the sortable element.
- sortable can be added to the root element.
- sortable-item can be added in item element, and follows ng-repeat.
- sortable-item-handle can be added to the drag handle in item element.
- All sortable, ng-model, sortable-item and sortable-item-handle are required.
- the no-drag attribute can be added to avoid dragging an element inside item-handle.
- Added a Jquery like 'containment' option to the sortable to prevent the drag outside specified bounds.

#### Callbacks:

Following callbacks are defined, and should be overridden to perform custom logic.

- callbacks.accept = function (sourceItemHandleScope, destSortableScope) {}; //used to determine drag zone is allowed are not.

###### Parameters:
     sourceItemScope - the scope of the item being dragged.
     destScope - the sortable destination scope, the list.

- callbacks.orderChanged = function({type: Object}) // triggered when item order is changed with in the same column.
- callbacks.itemMoved = function({type: Object}) // triggered when an item is moved accross columns.
- callbacks.dragStart = function({type: Object}) // triggered on drag start.
- callbacks.dragEnd = function({type: Object}) // triggered on drag end.

###### Parameters:
    Object (event) - structure         
             source:
                  index: original index before move.
                  itemScope: original item scope before move.
                  sortableScope: original sortable list scope.
             dest: index
                  index: index after move.
                  sortableScope: destination sortable scope.  
                  
##### Some Notable Fixes:

- Touch is allowed on only one Item at a time. Multiple Finger touch is prevented as like JQueryUI Touch Punch.
- Pressing 'Esc' key will Cancel the Drag Event, and moves back the Item to it's Original location.
- Right Click on mouse is prevented on draggable Item.
- A child element inside a draggable Item can be made as non draggable.

##### Usage:

Get the binaries of ng-sortable with any of the following ways.

```sh
bower install ng-sortable
```
Or for yeoman with bower automatic include:
```
bower install ng-sortable -save
```
Or bower.json
```
{
  "dependencies": [..., "ng-sortable: "latest_version eg - "1.1.0" ", ...],
}
```
Make sure to load the scripts in your html.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/ng-sortable.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="dist/ng-sortable.min.css">
```

And Inject the sortable module as dependency.

```
angular.module('xyzApp', ['ui.sortable', '....']);
```

###### Html Structure:

Invoke the Directives using below html structure.

    <ul data-sortable="board.dragControlListeners" data-ng-model="items">
       <li data-ng-repeat="item in items" data-sortable-item>
          <div data-sortable-item-handle></div>
       </li>
    </ul>

Define your callbacks in the invoking controller.

    $scope.dragControlListeners = {
        accept: function (sourceItemHandleScope, destSortableScope) {return boolean}//override to determine drag is allowed or not. default is true.
        itemMoved: function (event) {//Do what you want},
        orderChanged: function(event) {//Do what you want},
        containment: '#board'//optional param.
    };
    
That's what all you have to do.

###### Restrict Moving between Columns:

Define the accept callback. and the implementation is your choice.
The itemHandleScope(dragged Item) and sortableScope(destination list) is exposed. 
Compare the scope Objects there like below., If you have to exactly restrict moving between columns.

    accept: function (sourceItemHandleScope, descSortableScope) {
      return sourceItemHandleScope.itemScope.sortableScope.$id === destSortableScope.$id;
    }

If you want to restrict only to certain columns say you have 5 columns and you want 
the drag to be allowed in only 3 columns, then you need to implement your custom logic there.,
and that too becomes straight forward as you have your scope Objects in hand.

And reversing the condition, allows you to Drag accross Columns but not within same Column.

###### Horizontal Sorting:

Horizontal Drag and Drop can be achieved using the same Library. The Column dispaly can be tweaked to have horizonatal items and the same can be achieved via some CSS tweaks (like making the column display style to "inline-block"). Added a sample in the demo source (refer plunker.css/js/html).
